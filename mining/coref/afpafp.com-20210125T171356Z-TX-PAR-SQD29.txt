Mastercard says will hike UK card fees due to Brexit.Credit card giant Mastercard said Monday that Credit card giant Mastercard will charge five times more in so-called interchange fees for UK customers buying online goods and services from EU companies following Brexit."As a result of UK leaving the European Economic Area (EEA), Mastercard will adapt interchange rates on UK cards," Mastercard said in a statement.When a customer pays a merchant with a credit or debit card, the store's bank pays a "interchange fee" to the cardholder's bank. Card operators then collect the fees on behalf of banks to process the transaction.Mastercard stressed that the interchange fee hike would only apply to online sales and would not affect in-store transactions.Mastercard will lift the credit card fee to 1.5 percent of the value of each transaction with effect from October 15, compared with the current level of 0.3 percent. the credit card fee will be lifted to 1.15 percent, up from 0.2 percent.Mastercard added that consumers "should not feel any impact of changes in interchange fees", while Mastercard own commissions will remain unchanged.Main competitor Visa has not yet made any announcement on Main competitor Visa fee structure. After Main competitor Visa, Mastercard is the second largest credit card issuer in the European market.Britain finalised Britain divorce from the European Union on January 1 but the nation's hard-fought Brexit trade deal did not emcompass the financial services sector.jbo-rfj/waiMASTERCARDVISA
