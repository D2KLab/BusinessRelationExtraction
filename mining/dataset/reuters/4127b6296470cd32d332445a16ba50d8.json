We are in a climate emergency and we need phasing out of fossil fuels,\" Greenpeace's Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said at the Reuters Impact conference.\n\nShe said one issue with planting trees as offsets was that it takes 20 years for trees to grow and offset emissions happening right now. In the interim wildfires could destroy the chance of reductions.\n\n\"These offsetting schemes ... are pure 'greenwash' so that the companies, oil companies, can continue to do what they've been doing and make a profit,\" she said.\n\nThere have also been issues with how the credits are counted.\n\nIn April CarbonPlan, a group that researches the integrity of programmes designed to offset emissions, said that 29% of the forest carbon offsets it analysed in a $2 billion programme in California overestimated the amount of emissions they were offsetting, totalling 30 million tonnes or about $410 million. read more\n\nGreenpeace's warning comes at a decisive moment for the voluntary carbon market, whose proponents acknowledge the need to become more transparent and accountable. read more\n\nDelegates at the U.N. climate conference next month are expected to work on designing a market to channel money into offset and emissions removal projects in the fight to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change.\n\nHowever companies will need to stop investing in any new oil, gas and coal supply projects if the world wants to achieve net zero on schedule, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in April - the global watchdog's starkest warning yet to curb fossil fuels. read more\n\nTo watch the Reuters Impact conference please register here https://reutersevents.com/events/impact/"}
