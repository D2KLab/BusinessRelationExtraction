0,Google,"How Google Perfected the Silicon Valley AcquisitionIn late October John Hanke and several of his co-workers met for a reunion of sorts at Fiesta Del Mar, a Mexican restaurant near Google’s Mountain View headquarters."
1,Google,"Hanke, a 10-year Google employee who led initial development of Maps, was once the founder of a small geodata startup called Keyhole that Google acquired in 2004."
2,Google,"“There are quite a large number of [us] who are still at Google, and I have to say I don’t think anyone expected that when we first came in,” he says."
3,Google,Google has used acquisitions to expand its workforce and launch new products since before it was a household name.
4,Google,"“It’s almost a goal for some of these companies as they start, to have that exit event,” says George Geis, a business professor at UCLA whose upcoming book, Semi-Organic Growth, analyzes Google’s acquisition strategy over the years."
5,Google,A TIME analysis of startup founders’ LinkedIn profiles found that about two-thirds of the startup founders that accepted jobs at Google between 2006 and 2014 are still with the company.
6,Google,"Yahoo and Apple, which have both gone on acquisition sprees under new CEOs Marissa Mayer and Tim Cook in the last two years, now have a similar retention rate to Google."
7,Google,Google stands out among this cohort in large part because of the massive number of acquisitions it’s conducted.
8,Google,Overall at least 221 startup founders joined Google’s ranks between 2006 and 2014.
9,Google,"Google’s internal calculation of its overall retention rate for startup founders through its history is similar to TIME’s, according to data provided by the company."
10,Google,An examination of the ways Google tries to retain employees provides a window into the increasingly ferocious battle among the tech sector’s giants to expand through conquest.
11,Google,"“Google,” says Geis, “has done a pretty good job—among the best in Silicon Valley."
12,Google,"”‘The toothbrush test’Even when Google was small, it wasn’t shy about spending."
13,Google,"Since then, many of Google’s most well-known products, including Android, YouTube, Maps, Docs and Analytics, have originated from acquisitions."
14,Google,"“M&A has obviously been a huge part of Google—and, I think, Google’s success—for a long time,” says Don Harrison, Google’s vice president for corporate development, who oversees the company’s acquisitions."
15,Google,"Typically, Google buys occur in sectors where the company has already been experimenting itself."
16,Google,"Google already had a video sharing service called Google Video in the mid-2000’s, but YouTube’s fast-growing user base convinced the firm to offer a then-eye-popping $1.65 billion for the startup, even though it was barely a year old and earned no revenue."
17,Google,It’s important to Google and other tech giants that the founders behind ideas worth paying for stick around as well.
18,Google,Harrison says founder retention is one of the significant factors Google measures as part of the “scorecarding” it does to evaluate its purchases.
19,Google,"“We hold ourselves accountable to make sure that the founders are able to be successful within Google,” Harrison says."

23,Google,"Google had begun courting Nest almost from the company’s inception, ever since Fadell showed Google founder Sergey Brin a prototype of the Nest Thermostat at a TED conference in 2011."
24,Google,"When Google came knocking again, offering a big payday and the chance to keep Nest’s name brand intact—a key requirement for Fadell—an acquisition seemed more appealing."
25,Google,"The company launched in five new countries in 2014, but Fadell thinks they would have only reached two without Google’s help."
26,Google,"Harrison, Google’s M&A head, calls Fadell a “true CEO” and says Google execs serve more as a board of directors for Nest instead of supervisors."
27,Google,"Fadell says he hasn’t had to get formal approval for anything from Google, though he reports directly to Larry Page and meets with the Google CEO a few times per month."
28,Google,"Skybox Imaging, a satellite manufacturer that Google acquired for $500 million last summer, reports to the company’s vice president of engineering for geo products but maintains separate offices from Google in Mountain View."

30,Google,For a few years in the mid-2000’s Google handed out Founders Awards valued at as much as $12 million in stock to teams that developed successful new products like Gmail and Google Maps.
31,Google,"Google works closely with founders in their first 90 days on the job to insure they’re getting acclimated well, but check-ins on founders’ progress can continue for years, depending on the acquisition."
32,Google,At the core of Google’s pitch to founders is the opportunity for bountiful resources.

40,Google,"Harrison defends the deal as a smart acquisition because of the patent portfolio that Google acquired, helping the company defend itself from lawsuits by Apple and Microsoft (Geis, who has studied the transaction closely, called it “a wash” for Google).The Spree ContinuesAt Google, at least, there are opportunities for change for some founders who join the company."

45,startup,"Hanke, a 10-year Google employee who led initial development of Maps, was once the founder of a small geodata startup called Keyhole that Google acquired in 2004."
