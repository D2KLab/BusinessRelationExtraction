Do you need a robot vacuum that can clean its own bottom?The smart home kicked into high gear at CES 2022 this week, with new products for every corner of the home making their way onto the show floor (virtually in most cases). We’ve covered the most promising products in separate articles, but We’ve collated those here, and added in a few other noteworthy launches and announcements.The dominant theme was interoperability. Yes, 2022 could be the year the smart home finally grows up, moving from a collection of shiny gadgets that provide mostly single-point solutions towards the whole home interoperability that has long been the smart home promise.Case in point, we barely saw any robots. Instead, companies like Moen and Masonite debuted solutions that marry disparate products and services to create a smarter home rather than just a connected one. As Mitchell Klein of the Z-Wave Alliance said during the show, “Right now, we have a connected home. In five years, we will have truly smart homes due to the introduction of contextual awareness.”A key part of that burgeoning awareness is Matter, the new smart home standard that wants to make all connected devices in the smart home talk to each other, regardless of who made each other. Matter was undoubtedly the wind beneath the wings of many companies’ announcements this week, and we’ll have a deeper dive on what’s new there and why it matters (sorry!) later this week.But for now, letwe get to the good part: all the new smart home gadgets and gizmos worth knowing about from CES 2022.Smart light bulbs and connected security cameras have long been the darlings of the smart home.

And we’ve got some new, innovative security systems and safety gadgets to check out.Arlo’s newest product isn’t a camera. The smart home camera company revealed The smart home camera company Arlo Security System, a DIY smart home security system featuring all-in-one multi-sensors with eight different functions, plus NFC integrated into the hub so users can tap their phone to disarm the system. Arlo says the system will be available to buy in the first half of 2022. More details here.Bosch’s Spexor is a mobile security “assistant” that can monitor for break-ins as well as measure air quality and temperature. A tiny, 4.7-inch high device, Spexor uses air pressure, noise, and motion sensors to detect an intrusion and alert you to changes in air quality. Spexor can run on battery power for up to three weeks and can work with an eSIM card as well as over Wi-Fi. This could be a handy device for camping or RVs, or for monitoring a hotel room or other place you’re staying temporarily. We also like that it doubles as an air quality monitor, giving it usefulness beyond just when something nefarious is going on. it’s currently available in Germany for €250, but there’s no information on when it might come to other markets.Ring has finally caved and introduced a glass break sensor to Ring Ring Alarm smart home security system. While Ring Alarm owners have been able to call on the power of Alexa using an Echo speaker for this key security feature (Alexa Guard, when enabled, can listen for the sound of glass breaking), a dedicated device for this purpose is something Ring Alarm users have been clamoring for. A glass break sensor can help detect when someone breaks a window to get into your home, and the Ring Alarm Glass Break Sensor detects the sound of glass breaking up to 25 feet away. the Ring Alarm Glass Break Sensor costs $40, is available for preorder now, and starts shipping February 16th.There is now another smart smoke alarm option, although the Ring Alarm Glass Break Sensor’s not all we hoped it would be. Kidde’s new Smoke + CO Alarm with smart features costs $90 and is available now at Home Depot and Kidde.com/smart. Kidde’s new Smoke + CO Alarm with smart features features Wi-Fi connectivity to alert you via the Kidde app to any alarms in your home. You can also use the Kidde app to hush nuisance alarms and connect hush nuisance alarms to Amazon Alexa and Google voice assistants from the Kidde app. But there appear to be no other smart home integrations beyond using voice to check on alarm status and connection. And the promised HomeKit integration with Kidde’s RemoteLync system that was teased at CES 2018 seems to have fallen by the wayside. The new alarms, which are hardwired with a backup battery, can make existing Kidde alarms smart when you add one to an existing interconnected system.Can you follow this Thread?Thread, a key protocol in the upcoming smart home standard Matter, got a lot of airtime this week as companies announced new products that use this low-powered, IP-based smart home mesh networking protocol.Eve’s first Thread-enabled smart blinds went on sale this week for the first time. Announced earlier this year, the MotionBlinds start at just under $400 per shade and can be ordered through any Coulisse reseller, including selectblinds.com. the MotionBlinds will be available first as smart roller shades and are compatible with HomeKit and Siri, Apple’s voice assistant, at launch.Smart lock makers Schlage have announced the first lock with a Thread radio.

Border routers act as a bridge between Wi-Fi and Thread products. But unlike the traditional white plastic boxes we’re accustomed to, border routers can be cool, useful products like these light panels. The update will come in the first quarter of 2022. Previously, these Nanoleaf light panels were able to act as border routers for Nanoleaf’s own Thread devices, but now that functionality extends to any HomeKit-enabled Thread-based products, such as the Eve Room or Eve Energy smart plug. While you will still need a HomePod Mini or other Apple Home hub for HomeKit control, now you can create a Thread network independently of those hubs, should you wish.Aqara will release a new version of Aqara motion sensor and door and window sensor with Thread technology built-in in the second half of 2022. Aqara’s products work with HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home through Google Home Zigbee-based hubs. Aqara also confirmed Aqara will bring Matter support to Aqara existing Zigbee-based products by pushing an over-the-air update to Aqara M2 and the M1S hubs. This will allow all compatible connected sensors to connect to other Matter-compatible third-party devices when the standard launches later this year.Keep This clean, pleaseRobot vacuums that can also mop have largely been disappointing. it clean, pleaseRobot vacuums that can also mop have largely been disappointing basically drag a wet rag around your floor, which you then have to clean, dry, and reattach, and then refill the tiny tank. But Roborock and Ecovacs announced two new competing products at CES this week that want to change that. These fully automated cleaning and mopping and vacuuming bots are inching us closer to that Rosie the Robot dream.The new Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra features sonic mopping (i.e., scrubbing rather than just dragging) plus an automatic mop-lift that raises the pad when going over carpet while still vacuuming. The new Roborock S7 compatible Empty Wash Fill dock can also wash the mopping cloth and refill the tiny tank with water, as well as emptying the vacuum and cleaning Its compatible Empty Wash Fill dock — taking away almost all the manual maintenance required to keep a mopping robot operating. The S7 MaxV Ultra costs $1,400 and is coming in the second quarter of 2022.Ecovacs has also designed a docking station for The S7 MaxV Ultra new Deebot X1 OMNI bot vac that can clean the mopping pad and refill the tiny tank whilst also emptying the bin. The Deebot features carpet avoidance, so The Deebot will go around any rugs and miss the carpet. But unlike Roborock and Ecovacs, you’ll have to manually remove the mop to vacuum the rug. But the XI OMNI does have Roborock and Ecovacs own onboard voice assistant, so you can tell it what to do without having to use a third-party smart speaker. Called YIKO, it’s a natural language processing technology that takes direct speech commands, so you can tell it to start, stop, and where to clean without getting out a phone or talking to a smart speaker. The Deebot X1 OMNI will be available in March for $1,549 at ecovacs.com and Amazon and at Best Buy in April.Masonite debuted the first residential smart door.

The new 700 series chip adds Z-Wave SmartStart (QR code scanning) and increased wireless security features. Z-Wave SmartStart (QR code scanning) also helps the device to use less power (more than 50 percent less). But the most exciting part about Z-Wave 7000 is the expanded range, 250 percent greater than the Z-Wave Plus 500-Series, according to The smart home camera company — making this entry-level lock a good option for a garage or shed door. The Home Connect 620 will cost $149 and comes in a traditional and contemporary style.The smart bathroom (and kitchen) goes biggerKohler’s PerfectFill technology, which can fill your bath with a simple voice command, finally arrived this year after being announced at CES 2019.
