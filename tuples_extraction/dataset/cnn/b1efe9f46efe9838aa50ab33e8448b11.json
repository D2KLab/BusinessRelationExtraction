And money in the bank will finally earn something, albeit not much.\n\n\"Money will no longer be free,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US.\n\nWhen the pandemic erupted, the Fed made it almost free to borrow in an effort to encourage spending by households and businesses. And to further boost the Covid-ravaged economy, the US central bank also printed trillions of dollars through a program known as quantitative easing and rolled out emergency credit facilities.\n\nThe Fed's rescue worked. There was no Covid financial crisis. Vaccines and massive spending from Congress paved the way for a rapid recovery.\n\nBorrowing costs are going up\n\nEvery time the Fed raises rates, it becomes more expensive to borrow. That means higher interest costs for mortgages, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, student debt and car loans. Business loans will also get pricier, for businesses large and small.\n\nThe most tangible way this is playing out is in mortgages, where expectations of rate hikes have already driven up rates.\n\nBut it'll still be relatively cheap to borrow\n\nNone of this means it will suddenly become expensive to finance purchases.\n\nAnd if there are five rate hikes, the midpoint of the fed funds rate would be sitting at a relatively low 1.375%.\n\nStill, the impact to borrowing costs in coming months will depend chiefly on the speed of the Fed's rate hikes. There remains much debate about that, although Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday he believes there is \"quite a bit of room\" to raise rates without threatening the jobs market.\n\nRock-bottom rates have penalized savers. Money stashed in savings, certificates of deposit (CD) and money market accounts has earned almost nothing during Covid (and for much of the past 14 years, for that matter). Measured against inflation, savers have lost money.\n\nThe good news, however, is that these interest rates will rise as the Fed gets away from zero. Savers will start to earn interest again.\n\nBut this takes time to play out. In many cases, especially with traditional accounts at big banks, the impact won't happen be felt overnight.\n\nAnd even after several rate hikes, savings rates will still be very low -- below inflation and expected returns in the stock market.\n\nMarkets will have to adjust\n\nAll this free money has been amazing for the stock market. Zero percent interest rates depress government bond rates, essentially forcing investors to bet on risky assets like stocks. (Wall Street even has an expression for this: TINA, which stands for \"there is no alternative.\")\n\nAt a minimum, rate hikes mean the stock market will face more competition going forward from boring government bonds.\n\nThe goal of the Fed's interest rate hikes is to get inflation under control.\n\nThe high cost of living is causing financial headaches for millions of Americans and contributing significantly to relatively low levels of consumer confidence, not to mention President Joe Biden's low approval ratings.\n\nYet it will take time for the Fed's interest rate hikes to start chipping away at inflation. And even then, inflation will still be subject to the whims of the supply chain mess, strong demand. And, of course, Covid."}
