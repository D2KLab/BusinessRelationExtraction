The Seattle-based company, which faced operational disruption due to COVID-19, reported a profit for the fourth quarter.\n\nAn increase in COVID-19 infections among employees and winter storms have led to mass flight cancellations. Southwest has canceled more than 5,600 flights, thus far, this month, which is estimated to cost it $50 million in revenue.\n\nThe company said about 5,000 employees, roughly 10% of its workforce, had contracted the virus in the first three weeks of January.\n\nTo mitigate the staffing issues, it is offering pay incentives for operational employees through early February. It has also further cut its capacity for the first half of the year.\n\nThe company said its operation and staffing now have stabilized. All the incentives, however, are estimated to inflate its costs by $150 million in the current quarter.\n\nSouthwest has plans to add at least 8,000 employees to its workforce this year. But a tight labor market is driving up its wage costs. For example, it has raised starting hourly pay to $17 per hour from $15, which is estimated to cost the company $20 million-$25 million this year.\n\n\"The labor market continues to be a challenge,\" Chief Financial Officer Tammy Romo told investors on an earnings call.\n\nHigher labor and airport costs along with lower capacity are estimated to increase its overall costs by as much as 24% in the current quarter compared with the same period in 2019.\n\nThe company, however, expects cost pressure to peak in the current quarter.\n\nStrong holiday travel demand before the Omicron outbreak helped Southwest report an adjusted profit of 14 cents per share for the quarter through December, its first quarterly profit without U.S. government aid since 2019.\n\nReporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh; editing by Jason Neely, Elaine Hardcastle and Nick Zieminski"}
