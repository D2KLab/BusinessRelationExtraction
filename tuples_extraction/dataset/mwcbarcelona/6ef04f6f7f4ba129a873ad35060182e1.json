The leading independent travel management company will provide on-call support and consultancy for all those travelling to participate in MWC21.\n\nThe GSMA partnership with Gray Dawes Travel is the next step in our Committed Community plan. It is provided at no charge to MWC21 exhibitors, attendees, sponsors, and partners prior, during and post MWC21 Barcelona.\n\nJohn Hoffman, CEO GSMA Ltd, said: \"We are focused on helping to pave the way to MWC21 Barcelona, and continue to invest and support the MWC21 experience. We understand as global circumstances shift, expert travel advice and help are invaluable. That’s why we are providing a travel service from Gray Dawes. MWC21 attendees will have the travel support they need.”\n\nGray Dawes Travel will help with a range of travel-related advice and support covering Covid-19 considerations and PCR testing; travel documentation and visa forms; quarantine and border restrictions and travel itineraries. Travellers may also choose to work directly with Gray Dawes to book their flights.\n\nAllison Knight, Director of Operations, Gray Dawes Travel, said: \"We know that travelling right now can be a daunting experience. But we're here to accompany you at every stage of the journey. Our dedicated team of travel consultants, who fully understand the entire GSMA MWC Barcelona event, are on hand to answer all your travel questions.\"\n\nOur investment in our travel partnership with Gray Dawes continues our multi-layered plan to ensure a safe on-site environment for all attendees.

Attendees will be able to directly interact with each other as well as exhibitors in real-time.\n\nGray Dawes Travel, part of the Gray Dawes Group, is a leading and independent UK based travel management company with offices in London, Colchester, Manchester and Leamington Spa.
