Our goals include increased investment into research and development, expanding our sales and distribution networks, and firmly establishing HempFusion as a leader in the dynamic global CBD industry."

The Offering

The Offering was completed through a syndicate of agents led by Canaccord Genuity Corp., as sole bookrunner, and including Haywood Securities Inc. and PI Financial Corp. (collectively, the "Agents"). Each Unit offered under the Unit Offering is comprised of one Common Share (each a "Unit Share") and one-half of one Warrant. Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Common Share (each, a "Warrant Share") at a price of USD$1.20 per Warrant Share at any time until January 6, 2026. The Unit Shares are subject to a contractual hold period and may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise assigned or traded until May 6, 2021. The Warrant Shares will be subject to a contractual hold period and may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise assigned or traded until July 6, 2022.

The exercise price of the 2019 Warrants, each of which is exercisable to acquire one Common Share (each a "2019 Warrant Share", and together with the Offered Shares, the Units, the Unit Shares, the Warrants, the Warrant Shares and the 2019 Warrants, the "Securities"), was subject to adjustment based on the Offering Price and has now been confirmed at USD$0.85 per 2019 Warrant Share. The 2019 Warrant Shares will be subject to a contractual hold period and may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise assigned or traded until July 6, 2022.

Under the terms of an agency agreement entered into between the Company and the Agents, the Company has granted the Agents an over-allotment option (the "Over-Allotment Option"), exercisable in whole or in part, at the sole discretion of the Agents, at any time and from time to time, for a period of 30 days following the closing of the Offering, to purchase up to an additional 1,050,000 Offered Shares at the Offering Price per Offered Share and 1,500,000 Units at the Offering Price per Unit, for additional gross proceeds to the Company of up to USD$2,550,000.
