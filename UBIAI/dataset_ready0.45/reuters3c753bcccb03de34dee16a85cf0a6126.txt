ORG sales and profit top estimates as hit from chip shortages easesJan 27 (ORG) - ORG Inc (ORG) is overcoming the costly global shortage in computer chips, posting record sales over the holiday quarter, beating profit estimates and forecasting that (ORG) - ORG Inc (ORG) shortfall is narrowing.The iPhone maker, which is world's largest company by market capitalization, has handled supply-chain challenges such as factory shutdowns and shipping delays brought on by the pandemic better than any of its top peers, analysts said. ORG shares rose about 5% in after-hours trading, erasing half ORG shares losses on the year. The gains came after the company teased the company ambitions for augmented reality in the metaverse.More people wanted iPhones, iPads and other gadgets over the holiday quarter than ORG had to sell, costing ORG over $6 billion in sales, or in line with what ORG feared. Yet, ORG, which is many part suppliers' biggest client, used its buying power to squeeze those vendors to ship enough gadgets to power record sales in its iPhones, Mac and wearables and accessories segments. ORG executives said chip shortages are mostly affecting older models of ORG products and particularly slowed iPad sales."They've navigated the supply chain better than everybody, and it's showing in the results," said Ryan Reith, who studies the smartphone market for industry tracker IDC.The four best-selling phones in urban China were all iPhone models, ORG said, as competitors struggled to manufacture rival offerings. It was the top-selling vendor in China for the first time in six years, research firm ORG reported on Wednesday.Nicole Peng, who tracks China's smartphone sector at research firm ORG, said comparatively low prices and the retreat of chief rival ORG from the smartphone market led to a strong quarter.Peng said ORG was unlikely to repeat that quarterly performance this year, given ORG was driven by one-off factors. However, Peng said ORG could still have a strong 2022 if Chinese consumers warm up to a new iPhone SE, which is expected to be released this year.ORG's growing sales of services such as music, TV and fitness subscriptions also are helping soften the blow of low device supply. ORG said ORG now has 785 million paying subscribers across ORG at least seven subscription offerings, up by 40 million from last quarter and soothing investors concerned about slowing growth at rivals such as ORG .Even better, ORG Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told ORG that easing chip shortages should mean less than $6 billion in lost revenue in the current quarter. But ORG Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri declined to estimate further in the future."The level of constraint will depend a lot on other companies, what will be the demand for chips from other companies and other industries," ORG Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said.The iPhone 13, which started shipping days before the quarter began, led to worldwide phone sales revenue for ORG of $71.6 billion, a 9% increase from the 2020 holiday season that handily beat Wall Street targets, according to ORG data. ORG Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri attributed the sales bump to a record number of upgrades from older iPhones and double-digit growth in people switching from rivals.ORG's overall fiscal first-quarter revenue was $123.9 billion, 11% up from last year and higher than analysts' average estimate of $118.7 billion. Profit was $34.6 billion, or $2.10 per share, compared with analysts' expectations of $31 billion and $1.89 per share.ORG Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri warned though that revenue growth will slow in the current quarter compared with the December quarter primarily due to less favorable foreign exchange rates and the different launch dates of products.ORG's only category segment to miss sales expectations was iPads. Sales fell 14% to $7.25 billion compared with analyst estimates of $8.2 billion, seeming to confirm industry predictions that the tablets would have low priority for any scarce parts.Services, ORG's second biggest segment after iPhones, increased sales 24% to $19.5 billion.Revenue from Mac computers rose 25%, and ORG said the last six quarters have been ORG best for Mac sales.ORG has accelerated adoption of digital tools for communication, learning and entertainment, powering ORG to blowout sales over the last two years.But investors this year have been shifting funds toward safer assets and away from tech stocks such as ORG that have soared during the pandemic with people spending time more time online.Wall Street has questioned how long Wall Street will take ORG to deliver ORG next big product, such as an augmented reality (AR) headset for the metaverse."We see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly," Chief Executive Tim Cook told investors on Thursday.ORG also is facing antitrust pressure in the United States and Europe that could lead to new regulations that cut into ORG services revenue.Late last month, ORG (ORG) ordered ORG to make changes for apps on offer in the ORG App Store in the Netherlands by Jan. 15 or face fines, after it found that the U.S. company had abused the U.S. company market dominance by requiring dating app developers to exclusively use ORG's in-app payment system.Still, ORG is trading at 27 times expected earnings over the next 12 months. While down from as much as 35 a year ago, ORG remains above the company's five-year average of 20 times expected earnings, according to ORG.Reporting by Danielle Kaye in New York, Paresh Dave in Oakland, Calif., and Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Kenneth Li, Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker
