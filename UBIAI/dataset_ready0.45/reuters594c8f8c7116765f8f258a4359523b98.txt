ORG/Charles Platiau/File PhotoPARIS, Jan 27 (ORG) - The world's largest luxury goods conglomerate ORG (ORG.PA) sees soaring demand for The world's largest luxury goods conglomerate ORG (ORG.PA) fashion, handbags and jewellery continuing in 2022 after shoppers snapped up high-end wares over the holiday season.ORG, which owns brands spanning ORG cognac to cosmetics retailer ORG, said on Thursday fourth-quarter sales growth accelerated, reaching 20.04 billion euros ($22.34 billion) overall, with growth led by the French group's biggest earners ORG and ORG.The luxury labels propelled a 28% rise in sales of ORG's largest division, fashion and leather goods, on a like-for-like basis, beating analyst expectations for 16% growth. Revenues for the business in the last three months of last year came in 51% above their 2019, pre-pandemic level, the French group said.All divisions posted double-digit growth, percentage-wise, with the fastest pace marked by the specialised distribution division, which includes ORG, booking a 30% revenue rise over the quarter as consumers flocked to stores for holiday purchases at the end of the year."Following stronger than expected reporting from competitors like ORG, ORG and ORG earlier in the month, expectations were high going into the results. This results report did not disappoint even on the elevated expectations," said Christopher Rossbach, manager of ORG and CIO of ORGOn top of booming sales in Asia, ORG singled out the United States as ORG best-performing single country for sales, accounting for 26% of the total in 2021 - a factor which some analysts say will add to the group's strengths this year, especially since it bought jeweller ORG."Its greater exposure to the U.S. market – via the weight of ORG and ORG, disproportionate growth at ORG and now the integration of ORG – is a clear positive in our mind," said ORG in a note.ORG billionaire boss Bernard Arnault said strong momentum for the group continued in January, adding ORG could increase prices to protect margins in the current inflationary environment.ORG billionaire boss Bernard Arnault said that ORG, whose acquisition was completed a year ago, posted a record year in terms of sales and profit, even though its main flagship store in New York was closed for renovation throughout 2021. It's due to reopen this year.The luxury industry has rebounded strongly from the coronavirus crisis, lifted by pent up demand from consumers after months of lockdowns and store closures.ORG has tapped into this appetite for high end goods, and gained ground on rivals with active marketing campaigns targeting local consumers rather than relying on deep pocketed tourists. ORG fashion and leather goods increased market share to around 21% compared to 16% before the pandemic, according to ORG forecasts.Reporting by Mimosa Spencer and Silvia Aloisi, editing by Elaine Hardcastle
