ORG/Gustavo Graf/File PhotoMEXICO CITY, Jan 27 (ORG) - Shares of Mexican telecoms giant ORG fell on Thursday after a regulator scuttled ORG long-term goal to enter the local pay TV market, raising speculation over the next moves by the company controlled by the family of Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim.The stock dropped 3.94%, the biggest daily dip since September, exceeding the 1% decline in Mexico's ORG (.MXX), but analysts noted even broader losses on financial markets.The Mexican telecom industry regulator, ORG (ORG), concluded a vote on Wednesday without authorizing ORG a pay TV license in that country, a source with knowledge of the process told ORG/.ORG/ is already Latin America's largest pay TV provider, with markets that include Brazil and Colombia.The ORG and ORG declined to comment."I think now the real negotiations happen behind the scenes," said Roger Entner, an analyst at ORG. "Carlos Slim .... is not going to give up. Carlos Slim's pulled so many rabbits out of a hat, you lose count."Deemed a "preponderant agent" by the ORG due to the ORG market share, ORG had been barred from providing pay TV in Mexico since the privatization of state telecom firm ORG in the early 1990s. That later evolved into ORG.Chief Executive Officer Daniel Hajj had spoken of ORG ambition to get the permit by the end of last year.However, U.S. officials this month voiced concern to Mexican officials about competition if ORG was granted the license, ORG exclusively reported.ORG executives later called a news conference to say ORG executives wanted to meet U.S. officials to discuss ORG executives plans.ORG had pledged added investment of 8 billion pesos ($387 million) to expand ORG fiber optic network if ORG got the green light to enter pay TV.Entner at ORG said he believed ORG would still invest the money. "You're not going to cut off the nose to spite the face," he added.The failure to get a pay TV permit is unlikely to have a major financial impact, analysts said."We believe the outlook is favorable for ORG due to valuations, financial leverage," said independent analyst Carlos Hernandez. "In general, the view remains positive."Slim's good relations with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador may help, analysts said.The tycoon's construction arm ORG had come under fire for The tycoon's construction arm ORG role the building of a Mexico City metro railway line that collapsed in May, killing 26 people.The tycoon's construction arm ORG pledged to rebuild the damaged stretch at no cost to the government after an independent auditor found that missing bolts and poor welding contributed to the crash.Slim and Lopez Obrador are likely to act in accordance with longer term interests than the short term, said Ernesto Piedras, head of Latin American market consultancy ORG.
