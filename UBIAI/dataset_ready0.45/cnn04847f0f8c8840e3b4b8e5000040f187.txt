What is ORG and why it might be the weapon Russia fears mostLondon (ORG) Some are calling it the "nuclear option."As Western governments threaten Russia with a package of unprecedented sanctions aimed at deterring President Vladimir Putin from ordering an invasion of Ukraine, there's one measure in particular that appears to strike fear at the heart of the ORG: cutting Russia off from the global banking system.US lawmakers have suggested in recent weeks that Russia could be removed from ORG, a high security network that connect thousands of financial institutions around the world.Senior Russian lawmakers have responded by saying that shipments of oil, gas and metals to Europe would stop if that happened."If Russia is disconnected from ORG, then we will not receive [foreign] currency, but buyers, European countries in the first place, will not receive our goods — oil, gas, metals and other important components," Nikolai Zhuravlev, vice speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, said Tuesday, according to state media outlet ORG ORG was founded in 1973 to replace the telex and is now used by over 11,000 financial institutions to send secure messages and payment orders. With no globally accepted alternative, it is essential plumbing for global finance.Removing Russia from ORG would make it nearly impossible for financial institutions to send money in or out of Russia, delivering a sudden shock to Russian companies and their foreign customers — especially buyers of oil and gas exports denominated in US dollars.ORG is based in Belgium and governed by a board consisting of 25 people, including Eddie Astanin, chairman of the management board at Russia's ORG. ORG, which describes itself as a "neutral utility," is incorporated under Belgian law and must comply with ORG regulations.What happens if Russia is removed?There is precedent for removing a country from ORG.ORG unplugged Iranian banks in 2012 after they were sanctioned by ORG over Russia's nuclear program. Iran lost almost half of Iran oil export revenue and 30% of foreign trade following the disconnection, according to ORG."ORG is a neutral global cooperative set up and operated for the collective benefit of "ORG community," the organization said in a statement Wednesday. "Any decision to impose sanctions on countries or individual entities rests solely with the competent government bodies and applicable legislators," it added.It's not clear how much support there is among US allies for taking similar action against Russia. The United States and Germany have the most to lose if Russia is disconnected, because The United States and Germany banks are the most frequent ORG users to communicate with Russian banks, according to ORG.ORG is ready to respond to a Russian invasion of Ukraine with "comprehensive sanctions never seen before," Danish foreign minister Jeppe Kofod said on Monday. ORG chief diplomat Josep Borrell said Tuesday that sanctions would be "the most consequential leverage that the West, or at least ORG, has."British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told lawmakers on Tuesday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson government was discussing the possibility of banning Russia from ORG with The United States."There is no doubt that that would be a very potent weapon [against Russia]. I'm afraid it can only really be deployed with the assistance of The United States though. We are in discussions about that," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.Russia has taken steps in recent years to blunt the trauma should Russia be removed from ORG.Moscow established Russia own payment system, ORG, after it was hit by Western sanctions in 2014 following Russia annexation of Crimea early that year. ORG now has around 400 users, according to Russia's central bank. Twenty percent of domestic transfers are currently done through ORG, according to ORG, but the size of messages are limited and operations are limited to weekday hours.China's fledgling ORG, or CIPS, may provide another alternative to ORG. Moscow could also be forced to resort to using cryptocurrencies.But these are not appealing alternatives."ORG is an European company, an association of many participating countries. To make a decision on disconnection, a united decision of all participating countries is needed. The decisions of the United States and Great Britain are definitely not enough," Zhuravlev said, according to TASS."I'm not sure that other countries, especially those whose share of trade with Russia is large in balance, will support the shutdown," TASS."I'm added.
