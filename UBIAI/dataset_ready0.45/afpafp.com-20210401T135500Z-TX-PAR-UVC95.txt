Press Release from ORG: ORGORG (ORG: ORG), a global provider of enterprise software products and services, the leading third-party support provider for ORG and ORG software products and a ORG partner, today issued the following statement in response to a recent court order in the decade-long litigation between ORG and ORG, where the courts have found that third-party support and customization of enterprise software is permitted, ORG licensees have a choice of support vendors and, as stated by ORG, ORG provides third-party support for ORG's enterprise software in lawful competition with ORG's direct maintenance services:"On March 31, 2021, ORG issued an order resolving many outstanding disputes between the parties related to a permanent injunction that has been in place since 2018. a permanent injunction that has been in place since 2018 does not prohibit ORG's provision of support services for any ORG product lines, but rather defines the manner in which ORG can provide support services for certain ORG product lines.Most importantly, ORG ORG affirmed that there has been no finding of infringement by the Court of the Company's enterprise software support Process 2.0 or Automation Framework (AFW) tools, finding that, as ORG requested when it filed the ORG v. ORG litigation in 2014, those issues will be heard and decided by a jury.Additionally, ORG ruled in the Company's favor on the ability of ORG's engineers to learn and gain experience from their work. ORG has claimed that ORG engineers infringe ORG's copyrights and violate court orders by merely applying their learning and using know-how gained supporting one client to support other clients running the same licensed software. Building on ORG's previous denial of these ORG claims, ORG further noted in ORG most recent order that '[i]t is common sense that Rimini's engineers would get better and faster at conducting a task with more experience.' ORG also clarified and affirmed other important provisions of ORG previous and most recent orders in ORG's favor while denying ORG claims, stating that accepting some of ORG's claims would result in an 'absurd result.ORG also denied ORG's motions for sanctions, noting that it did not find any inappropriate conduct by ORG and therefore found no basis for any sanctions.ORG did find that ORG has violated the injunction in certain narrow instances and circumstances, including with respect to two deliverables relating to two specific clients in 2014 and 2015. However, the cited activities for these two specific deliverables occurred before the injunction was in place and therefore cannot be a violation of the injunction. ORG has scheduled an evidentiary hearing in September 2021.'For more than 15 years, ORG has brought disruptive, innovative support options to enterprise software licensees, delivered savings of more than $5 billion to date and achieved an average client satisfaction rating of 4.9 out of 5.0, where 5.0 is excellent.

'We plan to continue methodically prosecuting We litigation with ORG, including We claim of illegal anticompetitive conduct against ORG, and look forward to ultimately prevailing.'"About ORGORG (ORG: ORG) is a global provider of enterprise software products and services, the leading third-party support provider for ORG and ORG software products and a ORG partner.
