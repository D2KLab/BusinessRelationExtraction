ORG says will hike UK card fees due to Brexit.Credit card giant ORG said Monday that Credit card giant ORG will charge five times more in so-called interchange fees for UK customers buying online goods and services from ORG companies following Brexit."As a result of UK leaving ORG (EEA), ORG will adapt interchange rates on UK cards," ORG said in a statement.When a customer pays a merchant with a credit or debit card, the store's bank pays a "interchange fee" to the cardholder's bank. Card operators then collect the fees on behalf of banks to process the transaction.ORG stressed that the interchange fee hike would only apply to online sales and would not affect in-store transactions.ORG will lift the credit card fee to 1.5 percent of the value of each transaction with effect from October 15, compared with the current level of 0.3 percent. the credit card fee will be lifted to 1.15 percent, up from 0.2 percent.ORG added that consumers "should not feel any impact of changes in interchange fees", while ORG own commissions will remain unchanged.ORG competitor ORG has not yet made any announcement on ORG competitor ORG fee structure. After ORG competitor ORG, ORG is the second largest credit card issuer in the European market.Britain finalised Britain divorce from ORG on January 1 but the nation's hard-fought Brexit trade deal did not emcompass the financial services sector.jbo-rfj/waiMASTERCARDVISA
