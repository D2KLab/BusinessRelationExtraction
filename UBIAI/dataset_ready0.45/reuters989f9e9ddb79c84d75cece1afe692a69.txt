ORG's bets on ORG: human-like robots and self-driving carsThe interior of a ORG Model S is shown in autopilot mode in San Francisco, California, U.S., April 7, 2016. ORG/Alexandria Sage/File PhotoJan 27 (ORG) - ORG's (ORG) most important products this year and next will not be cars, Chief Executive Elon ORG said on Wednesday, but software that drives them autonomously and a humanoid robot.The audacious promises by the best-known billionaire in the electric car industry face major challenges, from technology to regulation. ORG and other auto technology companies have missed their targets to deploy self-driving cars for years."I love the fact that they're pushing the envelope, but I think they are too aggressive," said ORG analyst Craig Irwin.Chief Executive Elon ORG has built a career on defying skeptics with businesses in electric cars and rockets. Some ORG drivers buy $12,000 self-driving packages in the expectation that full autonomy is around the corner, and 60,000 ORG drivers are testing the latest self-driving software, a scale that rivals can only dream of."I would be shocked if we do not achieve full self-driving safer than human this year. I would be shocked," Chief Executive Elon ORG said, predicting full self-driving would become "the most important source of profitability for ORG.""It's nutty good from a financial standpoint," ""It said, noting that robotaxis would boost a vehicle's utility five times as owners can send owners cars out to work when not needed.Chief Executive Elon ORG said human-like robots and self-driving cars are more important than Cybertruck or $25,000 electric cars. ORG shares fell 10% to the lowest level in over three months on Thursday after the most valuable automaker delayed releasing new vehicles like Cybertruck until next year because of supply chain problems. Chief Executive Elon ORG said ORG is not currently developing $25,000 electric cars. read moreORG uses cameras and artificial intelligence, avoiding other technologies such as radar and lidar sensors that rivals say are key to achieving full autonomy. That approach has drawn fire."You have to be able to not only just see a person, like right in front of you, you have to do so, with 99.999999999% reliability. Even running over someone once is not an acceptable answer," Austin Russell, CEO of lidar maker ORG, told ORG.Philip Koopman, a ORG professor working on autonomous vehicle safety, said a big problem is that at scale, unusual cases constantly can crop up."Without a human driver to handle safety for novel situations the machine learning hasn't been taught already, it's very difficult to ensure safety in a completely automated vehicle," Philip Koopman, a ORG professor working on autonomous vehicle safety said.Even if the technology works, ORG would come under more rigorous scrutiny from regulators before deploying fleets of free-roaming robotaxis. U.S. auto safety regulators opened a safety probe into ORG's advanced driver assistant system after crashes involving the vehicles and parked emergency vehicles.Federal vehicle safety regulators have issued guidelines to states, but not comprehensive standards governing self-driving cars.Some state laws require approval for a fully autonomous vehicle, Koopman said.Just a year ago, ORG said during an earnings call ORG was "highly confident the car will be able to drive ORG with reliability in excess of human this year."ORG's autopilot engineer at the time, CJ Moore, last year told the California regulator that ORG's tweet on self-driving technology "does not match engineering reality."ORG also said engineers were working to launch a humanoid robot next year, called Optimus, that could eventually address global labor shortages, and in the short term might be able to carry items around a factory."For performing dangerous and repetitive tasks, using a humanoid robot is exactly the wrong approach," said Raj Rajkumar, professor of electrical and computer engineering at ORG.Robots may be more important than cars, ORG said. "This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time."
