Analysis: Europe could live with less Russian gas. A complete shutdown would be 'catastrophic'London (ORG) The United States and The United States allies are racing to draw up contingency plans in case supplies of Russian gas crucial to powering businesses and heating homes in Europe are choked off by conflict in Ukraine .Europe would struggle to survive for long without Russian gas, and finding alternative sources presents a huge logistical challenge — a reality that's stoking concerns about the continent's access to energy during an already difficult winter."There's not really a quick and easy alternative," said Janis Kluge, an expert on Eastern Europe at ORG.Senior ORG officials told reporters this week Senior ORG officials are talking to countries and companies about ramping up output. Senior ORG officials're also trying to identify alternative sources of natural gas that could be rerouted to Europe.Yet executing such a large intervention in energy markets would be tricky. New pipelines and gas liquefaction facilities take years to build. And redirecting large volumes of the fossil fuel at a time when the global market and transport networks are already stretched would require cooperation from major gas exporters like Qatar, which may not have much wiggle room.Nikos Tsafos, an energy expert at ORG, said minor supply disruptions would bend but not break the system. A worst-case scenario in which Russian gas disappears completely, however, would be a different story."A cutoff of gas flows through Ukraine is painful but manageable," Tsafos said. "A total cutoff of Russian energy exports would be catastrophic. There's no way for Europe to replace those volumes in any meaningful way."The scramble to secure energy supplies for Europe shines a light on how reliant the continent is on Russia to meet Russia needs. In 2020, Russia accounted for about 38% of ORG natural gas imports, shipping almost 153 billion cubic meters, according to data agency ORG."This is a kind of 'oh my God' moment where the region realizes it's extremely dependent on Russian gas," said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro research at the Dutch bank ING.A senior ORG official said that Russia would face major economic consequences if Russia decides to weaponize Russia energy exports. They noted that oil and gas export revenues provide Russia with half of Russia federal budget.But leaders in Europe and the United States remain worried that Russian President Vladimir Putin could still opt to leverage Russia's control of gas supply to increase pressure on Europe should the conflict escalate, eroding popular support for harsh Western sanctions. Preparations are also underway in case pipelines in Ukraine are damaged as a result of fighting there.How far can LNG go?One option to keep Europe supplied is redirecting shipments of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, which is transported by ocean tankers instead of via pipelines.Some of that supply has already been shifting to Europe, since producers are attracted by high prices. Europe is set to receive a record amount of LNG in January, according to ORG.But much more would be needed if imports from Russia drop sharply. That could be tough to secure, given how stretched the market is already."Global LNG production is already pretty much flat out," ORG said. Altering trade routes could also "place a strain on the shipping market," ORG added.A source with knowledge of the situation told ORG on Wednesday that Qatar could send some unallocated LNG to Europe, but for meaningful supplies to be delivered, existing customers would have to agree to defer existing customers orders. This could be made possible through diplomatic action by the United States and Europe, A source with knowledge of the situation added.China and Japan are the world's top importers of LNG, according to ORG.Tsafos of ORG said that LNG shipments could be used to blunt the impact of reduced Russian supply, but getting China and Japan to the countries in Europe that need China and Japan most would require complex logistics.In a report published this week, the think tank ORG noted that while the Iberian peninsula is a "hotspot for LNG import terminals," it wouldn't be easy to direct extra gas to the rest of Europe through existing pipelines because of capacity limits.A much more severe outcome would be if Russian gas supplies to Europe were cut entirely. In that case, it would be impossible to fill the hole in the coming months, given Russia's huge role in the region's energy ecosystem."This winter, there is simply no other solution than to keep importing Russian gas," said Kluge of ORG.Russia is not expected to take this route, which would dramatically escalate tensions and unite Europe against Moscow."The worst scenario of a total stop of Russian gas exports to the ORG remains highly unlikely, as it would mark a massive breach of contract by state-controlled supplier ORG," Henning Gloystein, director of the energy program at consultancy ORG, told clients Thursday.This would "shatter any the ORG illusions that Russia is a reliable supplier" and would likely trigger a "concerted effort" within the bloc to "permanently reduce gas imports from Russia as soon as possible," he added.But given Putin's unpredictability, government leaders are trying to prepare for all possibilities.Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told ORG's Christiane Amanpour on Wednesday that Russia "playing the gas card" with the West is "not a viable path." Norway, which provides roughly 20% of Europe's natural gas and sends the vast majority of that through undersea pipelines, will "deliver at the maximum of our potential," the prime minister added."We're not going to be able to replace Russia's gas but I think we have to count on the fact that it is in the mutual interest of the one who sells gas and the one who buys gas, that we continue to trade gas," the prime minister said.
