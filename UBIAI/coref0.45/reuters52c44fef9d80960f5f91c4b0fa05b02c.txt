"But local regulators are taking these steps with an eye on Russia."The global hashrate, which refers to the computing power used by computers connected to the bitcoin network, was reduced by about 20% this month because of political unrest and power blackouts in Kazakhstan, Binance estimated. read moreKostarev said the rate was now recovering.A Reuters investigation last week showed Binance withheld information about Binance finances and corporate structure from regulators, even as Binance welcomed government oversight and lauded Binance anti-money laundering programme.A Binance spokesperson responded saying Binance backed "technologies and legislation that will set the crypto industry on the road to becoming a well-regulated, secure industry."The investigation also found Binance acted against Binance own compliance department by recruiting customers in Russia and six other states deemed to be of "extreme" money-laundering risk.Binance said Binance had "one of the most sophisticated approaches" to enforcing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing in the finance sector and internal risk ratings were adjusted according to a range of variables.Reporting by Elena Fabrichnaya; Additional reporting and writing by Alexander Marrow; Editing by Edmund Blair
