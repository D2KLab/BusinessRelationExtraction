Press Release from ORG: ORG.ORG, a clinical stage pharmatech company using artificial intelligence (AI) to design patient-based drugs, announced that ORG, a clinical stage pharmatech company using artificial intelligence (AI) has completed a $225 million Series D funding round. ORG led the Series D and was joined by previous round lead investors, ORG and ORG managed by ORG. Other investors included ORG, ORG, ORG, ORG, ORG, ORG, ORG, ORG and ORG. In addition, ORG is providing an additional $300 million equity commitment that can be drawn at the ORG's discretion.ORG uses AI across ORG platform from target identification through drug design and patient selection in order to precision engineer new medicines. the ORG has advanced the first two fully AI-designed drugs into clinical trials and now has over 20 active programs in the ORG pipeline. Funding from the Series D round will be used to advance ORG's proprietary pipeline through clinical testing as well as to continue expanding the technology platform toward autonomous drug design.Commenting on the investment, Eric Chen, Managing Partner of ORG Investment Advisers, said: "ORG Investment Advisers believe ORG's innovative use of AI to discover and design better quality drugs with greater efficiency has the potential to create important medicines faster than ever before. With the convergence of technology and biology, drug discovery is rapidly evolving in ways that will reshape the industry. The ORG team have been leaders in AI-based drug discovery since the field's inception and we believe The ORG team will continue shaping The ORG team future."ORG has built and integrated a broad array of AI and experimental technologies to capture and utilize the most patient-relevant data to precision design drugs for multiparameter optimization. The ORG's platform evaluates the target and mechanism through high content phenomics, novel biophysics and deep learning from biological data. That information is then translated into the design of precision drugs through proprietary AI algorithms driven by thousands of models. By remaking the process of drug discovery, ORG is also able to reset industry standards for productivity. To date, The ORG has been able to advance seven precision designed drugs from project initiation to development candidate in an average time of 12 months.Andrew Hopkins, CEO of ORG added, "All of our investors share ORG's vision to discover better drugs, faster, through AI and automation. Our patient-first AI platform has repeatedly demonstrated Our patient-first AI platform ability to precision design drugs that address patients' needs. With the Series D completed, the quality and depth of our shareholder base allows our the freedom to continue to scale both our platform and pipeline."About ORGORG is an AI-driven pharmatech company committed to discovering and designing the best possible medicines in the fastest and most effective manner. ORG is the first company to progress AI-designed small molecules into the clinical setting and repeatedly demonstrate the ability of AI to transform how drugs are created. ORG's AI platform has now designed two drugs that are in Phase 1 human clinical trials.Drug design is precision engineering at the molecular scale. ORG has built dedicated AI systems that efficiently learn from the widest range of data and consistently reapply enhanced knowledge through iterations of design. Because ORG's AI platform learns more effectively and rapidly than human-led efforts alone, candidate molecules satisfying complex therapeutic requirements are created with revolutionary efficiency. ORG believes that designing better drugs, faster, will allow the best ideas of science to rapidly become the best medicines for patients.ORG has offices in Oxford, Miami, Osaka and Dundee.
