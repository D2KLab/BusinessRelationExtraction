"ORG is back at the top of the smartphone market after three quarters, driven by a stellar performance from the iPhone 13," ORG analyst Sanyam Chaurasia wrote in a separate report published last week by ORG, which did not break out its own measure of China sales data. "ORG saw unprecedented iPhone performance in mainland China, with aggressive pricing for ORG flagship devices keeping the value proposition strong." The end of the year is typically a good time for the California-based giant, as it coincides with new device releases from ORG's annual flagship September event. But ORG enjoyed a meteoric rise last quarter, as ORG quickly "rose to first place in China right after the iPhone 13 was released," according to ORG Research analyst Mengmeng Zhang. "Furthermore, ORG, ORG's main competitor in the premium market, faced declining sales due to the ongoing US sanctions," ORG Research analyst Mengmeng Zhang added. American restrictions have stifled the Chinese manufacturer's ability to obtain critical components for the Chinese manufacturer devices.
