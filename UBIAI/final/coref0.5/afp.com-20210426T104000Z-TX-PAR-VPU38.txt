Press Release from ORG: ORG.ORG (ORG), the applied research pillar of ORG (ORG), today announced that ORG (ORG), the applied research pillar of ORG (ORG) ORG (ORG) has developed the first simulation version of 'ORG', a versatile open-source quantum computing programming framework, in collaboration with researchers from around the world.Press Release from ORG: ORG features multimedia. View Press Release from ORG: ORG here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005389/en/Professor PERSON, Chief Researcher, ORG (ORG), ORG (ORG) (Photo: AETOSWire)The development follows a series of rapid announcements at ORG since the first ORG board meeting in August 2020.ORG strives to create innovation for a better world. The development of an open-source programming framework will have compelling benefits for the global research community.ORG is designed to support quantum algorithms across different computer systems, including support to hardware accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and multiple quantum devices. This versatility makes ORG easy to use for quantum programming and accelerates research and applications. Written in programming languages such as Python and PRODUCTC++, ORG is the entry point for a full stack programming platform, able to run quantum algorithms across different quantum computers and simulators.ORG is a joint project by ORG; ORG, the Barcelona-based quantum computing company; and researchers at other global centres. ORG's ORG team is led by Chief Researcher Prof PERSON. The first release of ORG was published in September 2020, with the final version set for launch within the next two years.Speaking on the announcement, His Excellency PERSON, Secretary General of ORG (ORG), said: "The fact that ORG is open-source will be a significant advantage to the world of programming and marks a major contribution to the research community and the advancement of scientific inquiry. Initial benchmark studies that show ORG outperforming other computing languages is a clear indication of the quality of research currently being undertaken at ORG at ORG."Prof PERSON, Chief Researcher at ORG, said: "PERSON, Chief Researcher at ORG are committed to innovation that transcends boundaries. The quantum advantage in computing will offer notable benefits to broader society, ranging from life-sciences, artificial intelligence, and finance."ORG is one of seven initial dedicated research centres that are part of ORG.
