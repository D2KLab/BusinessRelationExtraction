However, 38% cite security and data protection as the primary barrier to cloud transformation.Security and compliance play a critical rolePart one of the Cloud Impact Study, Bridging the Cloud Gap, found most survey respondents plan to take a hybridized approach to most survey respondents cloud infrastructure, with more than half (59%) of respondents saying most survey respondents will reduce most survey respondents on-premises infrastructure to some degree and increase public cloud deployments within the next 18-24 months. A further 66% intend to expand their private cloud workloads.According to data found in today's report, this expansion and diversification of infrastructure raises security and compliance issues among senior IT professionals, including:-- Control and governance (82%)-- Visibility through a single portal (81%)-- Ability to meet requirements of compliancy audits (80%)"Organizations are enjoying a newfound agility as they embrace hybrid cloud solutions, but scattered workloads present a security concern," explains PERSON, Global Head of Cloud at ORG. "A cloud environment is only as secure as the polices and controls an organization has in place, which is why they need to be built into the formation of any cloud strategy. Although no single solution on its own can guarantee 100% security, especially in a multi/hybrid cloud approach, experienced partners can assist organizations in choosing the right combination of security technologies that compliments experienced partners workloads no matter where experienced partners are hosted and ensure visibility across disparate environments.""Security teams are tasked with protecting a widening attack surface, often with limited budgets and resources, against bad actors who are employing the same sophisticated techniques as top cybersecurity providers," said PERSON, VP of Partner Sales and Alliances, ORG. "With the ubiquity of cloud and hybrid environments, containerization, and mobile, IoT, and other edge devices, the traditional notion of a perimeter is no more. To be effective, security solutions must enable total visibility across an organization's IT estate to help organizations quickly identify, prioritize, and respond to all threats that surface."Together, ORG and ORG partner to safeguard business critical data across the infrastructure and application stack, merging security technology, threat intelligence and 24/7 security experts to deliver security outcomes to businesses in an as-a-service model.The study's results reinforce the importance of incorporating security into cloud architectures from design through to implementation and transformation.
