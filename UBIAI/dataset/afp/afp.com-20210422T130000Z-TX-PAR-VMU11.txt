By leveraging the Autofleet platform, Bluebird will be able to optimize its fleet's vehicle placement, match and predict drivers based on demand forecasting to reduce empty rides, optimize allocation efficiency, allow for greater availability in traditionally under-served areas, reduce customer ETAs and improve overall customer experience. Autofleet is ingesting data from rides requested through the operator's digital app and through traditional street hailing. These inputs are combined with real-time traffic data, weather forecasts, local events and other data points for increased demand prediction accuracy.

"The demand for mobility services has evolved, and it poses challenges that can only be solved by a combination of AI driven technology, and best in class operations. It is Bluebird's value and commitment to deliver such customer-centric innovation through sustainable cooperation with our strategic partners, Autofleet and ABeam Consulting," said Paul Soegianto, Chief Strategy Officer of PT Blue Bird Tbk.

In business for nearly 50 years, Bluebird serves millions of passengers every month. The fleet includes regular taxis (Bluebird & Pusaka), executive taxis (Silverbird), limousines and car rentals (Goldenbird), bus charters (Bigbird) and logistics (Birdkirim) among others. Autofleet's platform will be integrated into the current dispatch infrastructure, supporting Bluebird, Silverbird and Birdkirim services in its first phase. In the longer term, the collaboration will inform Bluebird's expanded activities in logistics and delivery services as well as exploration of new mobility infrastructure including electric vehicle (EV) charging.

"We are excited to partner with Bluebird, already a leader in mobility services in Southeast Asia, and apply the Autofleet platform to power current operations and prepare the business for future strategy and growth," said Kobi Eisenberg, CEO at Autofleet. "Deploying Autofleet's platform will keep Bluebird at the cutting edge of the mobility industry, providing an outstanding customer experience, in a very competitive market."

"ABeam Consulting is thrilled to support and expand Bluebird's innovative services through AI and machine learning to increase operational efficiency," said Tatsuya Kamoi, CEO at ABeam Consulting. "With our deep expertise in Mobility as a Service, we will support Bluebird's operations and apply industry best practices to stay competitive with leading rideshare companies."

In September 2020, Autofleet and ABeam Consulting entered a partnership to offer a comprehensive solution that supports Mobility as a Service (MaaS) projects end-to-end from the proposal stage to system implementation. Following projects in Japan and Cambodia, the engagement with Bluebird was secured through a year-long competitive proposal process and represents the largest commercial fleet management opportunity arising from the partnership to date.
