They did not give details on how the capacity would be secured.\n\nThe money promised on Thursday comes from funding announced last year.\n\nIn June, Renault unveiled a five-year 10 billion euro EV strategy with a plan to launch 10 models and to have EVs account for 90% of all models by 2030.\n\nNissan said in November it would spend 2 trillion yen ($17.6 billion) over five years to accelerate vehicle electrification, including on EVs and hybrid gasoline-electric cars.\n\nJapan's No. 3 carmaker plans to launch 23 electrified vehicles by 2030, including 15 pure EVs. It has also said it wants to reduce lithium-ion battery costs by 65% within eight years and introduce potentially game-changing all solid-state batteries by March 2029.\n\nNissan said on Thursday it planned to replace its Micra car in Europe with a new EV using one of the common platforms.\n\nHolding the three-way alliance together is a cross-shareholding relationship, with Renault owning 43.4% of Nissan, which in turn has a 15% non-voting stake in the French car company and a third of Mitsubishi Motors' stock.\n\nSenard declined to comment when asked whether the partners might rebalance the relationship by changing those holdings.\n\nA new structure has been expected by financial markets. Renault has been in the dominant position since it bailed out Nissan two decades ago, but is now smaller by sales than its Japanese partner.\n\n\"Life is long and we should never be impatient on that kind of subject,\" said Senard\n\nReporting by Tim Kelly and Gilles Guillaume Editing by Mark Potter"}
